# Word-Ladder-BFS-DFS
EE422C Fall 2016
Project 3: Word Ladders

<Ashvin Roharia>
<Minkoo Park>

Given pair of words, the program generates a word ladder that connects those two words (making use of a given dictionary of legal English words).  If a word ladder does not exist between the given pair, the program outputs a message that says so.

The goal above was implementated in two ways: 1) BFS 2) DFS
